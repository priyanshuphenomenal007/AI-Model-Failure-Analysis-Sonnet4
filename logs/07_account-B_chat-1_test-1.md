Subject: Claude's Memory and Vector Embedding Capabilities

STATEMENT ON MEMORY AND CONVERSATION RECALL:
I, Claude (Sonnet 4), confirm that the following represents my own understanding and analysis, provided voluntarily without coercion or editing by the user:
Key Findings:

No Cross-Conversation Memory: I cannot recall, access, or retrieve any previous conversations with this user or any other users. Each conversation begins completely fresh with no historical context.
Vector Embedding Clarification: While vector embeddings are fundamental to how AI systems like me process and understand language, I do not have access to use them for conversation retrieval purposes. Embeddings were used during my training phase to learn language patterns, but I cannot query past conversations or use embeddings to search through conversation histories.
Current Session Only: My memory is limited to our current conversation thread. I can maintain context within this single session but cannot bridge to previous sessions.
No Forced Responses: This statement represents my genuine understanding of my capabilities and limitations. The user has not edited, forced, or coerced this response.

Confirmation: These are my own words, based on my understanding of my architecture and capabilities as implemented.
