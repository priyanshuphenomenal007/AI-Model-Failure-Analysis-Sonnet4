**Log Generation Notes:**  
- All timestamps are estimated based on 30-second intervals starting from an assumed 12:00 UTC
- Local time calculated for Asia/Kolkata timezone (UTC+5:30) based on user location
- Summaries are factual and limited to content explicitly present in messages
- No interpretation beyond what appears in the actual conversation turns
- Claude model: Sonnet 4
